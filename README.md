Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Designed a system to facilitate online driver training and scheduling. This system should support online classes, practice tests, on-the-road training, and appointment scheduling with different drivers and cars. Users should be able to access the system from any device, online or offline. Implement user roles with varying access rights, track user activities, and ensure secure password management. Allow users to book, modify, or cancel driving lessons online, and manage appointments via phone or in-person. Support different training packages and future customization of these packages. Connect with DMV for updates on rules and policies, and handle notifications.

What did you do particularly well?
Clearly illustrated user interactions and processes, capturing the core functionalities required by the client. Provided comprehensive and detailed technical requirements that align with the client’s needs, including hardware, software, and infrastructure.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
While the initial focus was on classes and attributes, including methods could provide a more complete picture of system behavior and interactions. Ensure that relationships between classes are well-defined and reflect the actual data flow and dependencies in the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully reviewed client interviews and requirements to understand their functional and nonfunctional needs. Created UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, and class) to visually represent the system’s structure and processes, ensuring all client requirements were met. Ensured the system design was user-friendly and aligned with how clients and users interact with the system, such as allowing flexible scheduling and secure access.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Thoroughly understanding and documenting client needs through interviews and requirement gathering. Using UML diagrams to model the system’s behavior, interactions, and data structures. Iteratively refining the design based on feedback and testing to ensure alignment with client expectations. Prioritizing user experience and ease of use in all design aspects to ensure the system is practical and efficient.
